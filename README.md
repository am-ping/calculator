# [Calculator](https://am-png.github.io/calculator/)
Repository of my calculator project. Initially forked from [here](https://github.com/leonnoel/100devs-calculator) which is when I started working on it.

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Optimizations
I refactor as much as I can as long as the code is readable/easy to understand.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned many unique algorithms as well as the fact that I need to have a growth mindset as I have a long way to go.
